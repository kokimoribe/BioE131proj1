# BioE131proj1

- Objective: Write a program that retrieves information across health science databases based on a search query and use that information to create a biology-themed card game.
- Outcome: Wrote a program in Biopython that automates the use of a federated search engine, known as Entrez, to find proto-oncogenes found in humans. The program fetches information about each proto-oncogene and filters the analyzed results to obtain 30 proto-oncogenes deemed unique by the team’s defined criteria. The program then outputs the 30 proto-oncogenes and their information in a formatted text file, which is then used to create a card game.
- Contribution: Took the initiative of developing the program’s algorithm by learning Biopython and then teaching it to the rest of the team members. Wrote the majority of the program while making sure team members understood how the program’s algorithm worked.
